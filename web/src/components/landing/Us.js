        <h2>How we start</h2>
        
        In 2018 we start our activity in provinding fresh fruit.
       Our fruit buying team hand-select our fresh fruit from the fruit markets before the break of dawn every morning. We carefully select our fruit mix to ensure it is of premium quality, has great taste and is at the "breaking point of ripeness".
       At the Fruitful Packhouse, we prepare the fruit to make it convenient for the workplace e.g. we separate the bananas and grapes into individual portions. This prevents the hoarding of fruit by certain more eager employees! All the fruit is checked for quality issues before being included in the baskets or boxes. We also de-sticker the fruit - this may seem like a small feature of our service, but it allows our team to check the fruit quality again before being placed in the baskets or boxes.
       In transit, our fruit is handled with the maximum care from the market to drop-off, so that it reaches you in perfect condition.
